# The History Machine

## World's first open source science fiction book

The book is based on the idea that light interacts with gravitational waves.
We can take advantage of this fact to "see" the entire history of the earth.

The book will explore all possibilities of such an evolved and intelligent human race which can do all sort of magical things.
