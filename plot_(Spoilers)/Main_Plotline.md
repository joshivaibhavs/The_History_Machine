# The History Machine

## Premise

Light interacts with gravitational waves. This disturbance can be measured. - "Chronoscreening"

* Plot line 1 - A mad scientist develops a history machine (which can create a clear picture of the Earth moment by moment - all the way to the beginning of the earth by analyzing the light-gravity interaction). This scientist then goes on to control the entire world

* Plot line 2 - The humanity is now aware of the entire history of the Earth (using the History Machine) and a group of scientists is trying to solve a problem that might end up killing off the human race.

* Plot line 3 - A multi-planetary human race has access to the entire history of the solar system and they are trying to embark on a journey to revive the life forms which were present before humans on other planets


Finalized plot line:

Plot Line 3:

Core Concept: A sprawling human civilization across multiple planets uses chronoscreening to uncover and revive extinct life forms on other worlds. The goal - avoid the Great Filter.
Expanded Outline:
Character - Ananya Desai (The Xenobiologist): Driven by a deep respect for all life, she leads the "Planetary Restoration Initiative." She's optimistic but faces bureaucratic hurdles and ethical dilemmas. Her romantic interest, Maneesh Gurtu, is a pragmatic engineer focused on the technical challenges of reviving extinct species.
The Setting: Centuries in the future, humanity has colonized numerous planets within the solar system. Chronoscreening reveals that many worlds once teemed with life – now vanished due to void mushroom - a cosmic event causing inter-galactic mass extinctions.
The Mission: Ananya’s team uses chronoscreening to reconstruct the genetic blueprints of extinct species from fossilized remains and atmospheric traces. They then attempt to "reseed" these worlds using advanced bioengineering techniques to uncover the secrets those life forms held before the last void mushroom.
Ethical Conflicts: The revival process isn't without risk. Some argue that resurrecting extinct life forms could disrupt existing ecosystems or even create new dangers. Others question whether humanity has the right to play “god.”, but all want to know what knowledge about the universe, life, and the extinction events the old life forms have to offer.
The climax: The climax involves successfully reviving a complex ecosystem on Mars – a vibrant, alien landscape teeming with resurrected flora and fauna. The visual representation of this rebirth is breathtaking, showcasing the potential for planetary restoration. This rejuvenation brings back a long lost super-intelligent species which can uncover the secrets of the greate filter humanity faces in the next century - a cosmic event triggered at the center of the galaxy causing all planets to start erratically creating cataclysms which would wipe out 99% of life within the galaxy.
Themes: Environmental responsibility, the interconnectedness of life, the ethics of genetic engineering, universal catastrophe, hope for the future.
Scientific/Technological Considerations: This plot line relies heavily on advanced bioengineering and terraforming technologies. Chronoscreening would be used to analyze ancient atmospheric conditions and reconstruct DNA sequences from fragmented remains. Caveat: Requires significant handwaving regarding DNA preservation and genetic reconstruction.
Question: What responsibilities do we have to the life that existed before us, even if it’s long gone? Will they answer our questions or come for our life?

Self insert - A geeky quantum computer scientist helps Maneesh and Ananya decode most of the xeno-DNA but dies during a space mission. The scientist could speak multiple languages of the worlds and could play musical instruments.
