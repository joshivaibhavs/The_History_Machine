# The History Machine

## Premise

Light interacts with gravitational waves. This disturbance can be measured.

* Plot line 1 - A mad scientist develops a history machine (which can create a clear picture of the Earth moment by moment - all the way to the beginning of the earth by analyzing the light-gravity interaction). This scientist then goes on to control the entire world

* Plot line 2 - The humanity is now aware of the entire history of the Earth (using the History Machine) and a group of scientists is trying to solve a problem that might end up killing off the human race.

* Plot line 3 - A multi-planetary human race has access to the entire history of the solar system and they are trying to embark on a journey to revive the life forms which were present before humans on other planets
